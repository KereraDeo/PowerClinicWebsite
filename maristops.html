        <h2>What is antenatal care?</h2>
<p>Antenatal care is provided to you during pregnancy to help improve your maternal wellbeing, and ensure you can prepare for a safe birth.</p>
<p>By detecting and managing any health issues during pregnancy, antenatal care can improve the health of your unborn baby and reduce the risk of low birth weight and other more serious issues.</p>
<p>Antenatal care can include such things as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your medical history and any pre-existing maternal medical conditions</li>
<li>Discussions around pregnancy complications</li>
<li>Lab testing</li>
<li>Ultrasound scans</li>
<li>Steps towards healthy lifestyles  </li>

        <h2>What happens during antenatal care?</h2>
<p>Antenatal care takes place across at least 8 spaced clinic visits, finishing close to your due date. During your first antenatal care session, you’ll have a pregnancy test to confirm that you are pregnant, and we’ll estimate your expected date of delivery.</p>
<p>We will discuss your medical history and you’ll have a clinical examination to assess your general health and examine your pregnancy. This will help us to determine whether your pregnancy might be high risk or not, and ensure we can work with you to develop a suitable birth plan.</p>
<p>A number of tests and immunizations will be done, such as STI and HIV screening, blood tests and preventative treatment for malaria. You can rest assured that any care you receive will be tailored to suit your needs.</p>
<p>We’ll also give you information to help you prepare for birth and beyond. You will receive information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivery in a healthcare facility</li>
<li>Healthy behaviours</li>
<li>Newborn care</li>
<li>Breastfeeding</li>
<li>Postnatal care</li>
<li>Planning for child spacing</li>
</ul>
